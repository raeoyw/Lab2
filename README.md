# Lab2

In this lab, I used geosearch.ipynb and Twitter API to collect geo-tagged tweets in the U.S. and used QGIS and word cloud generators to analyze the specific location and content of all these collected tweets.
I ran geosearch.ipynb twice, and each time I produced individual tweets data, map, and word cloud. At the first time, I ran the crawler at around 11 p.m. GMT+0 on Wednesday, which was around 7 p.m. in the East part of America and around 4 p.m. in the West. It meant that people in the East were in the break time while people in the West were still in their work places. As a result, the location of tweets collected were all concentrated on the East, especially on New York and New Jersey, as we can see from the map 1. Because it was off time in the East, the word cloud of these tweets shows us people were mostly talking about life after work, as we can see from it that words with high-frequency include "driver", "park", "talking", "baby"...
At the second time, I ran the crawler at around 9 p.m. GMT+0 on Monday, which was around 5 p.m. in the East and 2 p.m. in the West. This time, both people tweeted actively as we can see from the map2. I guessed it was because West people were at the break time and East people were going to get off. However, because it was still during the work hour, most tweets were talking about jobs as we can see from the word cloud that high-frequency words include "job", "think", "know".
